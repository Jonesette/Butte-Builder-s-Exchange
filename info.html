		<h1>Online Projects</h1>
		<p>Plans listed as online only are due to the concerted effort to pick up as many jobs in Montana aand neghboring states as possible.</p>
		<p>Often these jobs are sent to another exchange and the plan issuer is okay with us picking it up electronically from the exchcange but does not want to send a hard copy.  These jobs can be viewed online, and we can print out hardcopies here at the exchange.</p>
